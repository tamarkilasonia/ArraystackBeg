# Generic Stack Data Structure in Java

This project implements a **generic stack data structure** in Java using arrays. It follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. The `ArrayStack` class provides essential stack operations such as:  

- **`push`** â€“ Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
- **`pop`** â€“ Removes and returns the top element.  
- **`peek`** â€“ Views the top element without removing it.  
- **`isEmpty`** â€“ Checks if the stack is empty.  
- **`size`** â€“ Returns the number of elements in the stack.

###  **Advanced Features**  
In addition to basic functionalities, this implementation includes advanced features like:  

- **Dynamic Resizing** â€“ The stack grows or shrinks based on usage, optimizing memory efficiency.  
- **`clear()` Method** â€“ Efficiently empties the stack.  
- **`contains()` Method** â€“ Checks for the presence of specific elements.

###  **Why Use This Project?**  
This project is ideal for:  
- Learning about **data structures in Java**.  
- Demonstrating the power of **generics**.  
- Showcasing **good software design principles** with an emphasis on performance and usability.

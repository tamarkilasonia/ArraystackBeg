# Generic Stack Data Structure in Java


This project implements a **generic stack data structure** in Java using arrays. It follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. The `ArrayStack` class provides essential stack operations such as:  

- **`push`** – Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
- **`pop`** – Removes and returns the top element.  
- **`peek`** – Views the top element without removing it.  
- **`isEmpty`** – Checks if the stack is empty.  
- **`size`** – Returns the number of elements in the stack.

###  **Advanced Features**  
In addition to basic functionalities, this implementation includes advanced features like:  

- **Dynamic Resizing** – The stack grows or shrinks based on usage, optimizing memory efficiency.  
- **`clear()` Method** – Efficiently empties the stack.  
- **`contains()` Method** – Checks for the presence of specific elements.

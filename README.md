This project implements a generic stack data structure in Java using arrays. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. The ArrayStack class provides essential stack operations such as push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size.

In addition to basic functionalities, this implementation includes advanced features like dynamic resizing, allowing the stack to grow or shrink based on usage, thus optimizing memory. It also offers a clear method to efficiently empty the stack, and a contains method to check for the presence of specific elements.

This project is ideal for learning about data structures in Java, demonstrating the power of generics, and showcasing good software design principles with an emphasis on performance and usability.
